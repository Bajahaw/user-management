## What is this?

This is a simple user management system that should allow users to register, login, and logout. The system is built
using Html/Css, some js, and java with Spring boot and maven.

The system currently uses an in-memory database for the purpose of development.

### Authentication

The system uses JWT for authentication. The JWT token is generated when a user logs in and is stored in the local
storage.
